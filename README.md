# Airbnb-Data-Analytics-Project
I obtained the latest data from the Airbnb website of Amsterdam, North Holland, The Netherlands (3rd September, 2023). I will do different analysis on this data and my projects here.

### Project Overview

Applying various important data science skills like: data importing and cleaning to analyze the Airbnb market in Amsterdam, also ingest and combine the data, and clean strings and format dates to extract accurate information.

### Dataset

You can find dataset in : [Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/)

### Project Libraries and Modules

* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)

### Project Outline

* Data Importing: using various techniques to import data such as:`.csv`.
* Data Merging and Aggregation: joining multiple DataFrames from different data sources together and aggregate.
* Feature Engineering: Creating new columns from the old ones to highlight some of the columns features 
* Data Exploration: using Pandas `head()` , `describe()` and `info()` method, we get a closer look at DataFrames.
* Data Cleaning: by elimnating unnecessary data from our columns and ensuring they have the desired data type from: `str`, `int` and `category`, also by insuring that we have the right ranges for our data and doesn't contain `NULL` or `NA` data.
* Data Analyzing: gainig insights from the data, by comparing costs to the private rental market, knowing the timeframe are we working with, Analyzing listing prices and prices ranges by Amsertdam neighbourhood_cleansed, also highlighting most important summary statitics for various columns and DataFrames.
